# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles using Rust.

To execute the solution for a given day:

1. Make sure you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. Place the inputs in a file named `input.txt` in the `src` directory for that day. For example, for day 1 `./day01/src/input.txt`.
3. Specify which day should be executed. For example, for day 1:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin day1
    ```
